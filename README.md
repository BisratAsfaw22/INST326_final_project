Final Project : Grocery Store Simulator

Overview:

We created a grocery store simulator that allows users to submit their grocery shopping list before heading to the grocery store. Based on their shopping list, our simulator will check which items are currently found or not found in the store and give detailed information about the items. For those items found, it will calculate the total cost, discounts through coupons and veteran status, and suggest other items based on category and price similarities. There is also a search bar that allows users to look for any additional items outside of their grocery shopping list and check for price if the item is found. At the end, it allows users to rate their experience and leave a review while also viewing those left by previous users.

Necessary Files:

sample_items.txt: A text file of the grocery shopping list items the user submits.
grocery_store.csv: A spreadsheet file of all the available items/products in the grocery store.
reviews.txt: A text file of reviews left from other users.

Running the Program at the Command Line:

	To run the program within the Visual Studio Code built-in terminal, type “python3” (macOS) or “python” (on Windows), followed by the name of the program (“grocery.py”), and the necessary files. It should look like this: “python3 (or python) grocery.py grocery_store.csv sample_items.txt reviews.txt”. User input is required for the veteran discount, rating, and review methods.
